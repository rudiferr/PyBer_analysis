# "PyBer_analysis" Week 5 Challenge
## Overview of the PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
<!--- Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->
After performing the initial analysis and creating a bubble chart of the PyBer ride sharing data, we saw that average fares of under-serviced cities were drastically higher compared to those that have a high presence of available drivers.

We were tasked with creating a new dataframe to analyze the weekly shifts in the average fare of each city to get a better understanding of what changes need to be made.

## Results
<!--- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. --->

The dataframe above shows that there is an inverse relationship with the Average Fare per Ridee ecompared to every other metric; this results in a disparity for the consumer that in turn is not profitable for PyBer.

The linechart above shows that total ride fares fluctuate greatly in the Spring season, with peak profit happening during February and potential revenue being incredibly inconsistent throughout the month of March. Things become more interesting at the end of April, where urban environments are producing the same highs from February, suburban areas are also trending upwards, but rural communities are outputting low numbers and continuing to trend downwards.

## Summary
<!--- Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. --->
As obtained from the bubble chart made earlier, we can conclude that ride counts and driver availability are directly proportional to each other, while average fares are inversely propotional to the prior mentioned. Though, the question becomes, "Which of the three is the primary driving factor?" I would suggest more research put into this, as immediately claiming such things as, "Let's create more incentives to have drivers in underserved areas," or "Let's artificially lower the rates so that
