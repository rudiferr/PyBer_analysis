# "PyBer_analysis" Week 5 Challenge
## Overview of the PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
<!--- Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->
After performing the initial analysis and creating a bubble chart of the PyBer ride sharing data, we saw that average fares of under-serviced cities were drastically higher compared to those that have a high presence of available drivers.

We were tasked with creating a new dataframe to analyze the weekly shifts in the average fare of each city to get a better understanding of what changes need to be made.

## Results
<!--- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. --->
